## DataStore Integration Tests (Flutter)

The purpose of this test suite is to test the DataStore API signatures that are consumed by the amplify-flutter library using serialized models. The tests contained in this suite should follow the same patterns and implement the same test cases as the AWSDataStoreCateogryPluginIntegrationTests suite.

Accordingly, these tests use the same schemas as the AWSDataStoreCateogryPluginIntegrationTests suite. Identical setup steps can be followed here, and the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file can be consumed from the same path.

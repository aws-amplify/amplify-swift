# DataStore Primary Key Integration Tests

The following steps demonstrate how to setup a GraphQL endpoint with AppSync and IAM.
This configuration is used to run the tests in `AWSDataStorePrimaryKeyTest.swift`.

### Set-up

1. `amplify init`

2. `amplify add api`

```perl
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: GraphQL
? Here is the GraphQL API that we will create. Select a setting to edit or continue Authorization modes: API key (default, expiration time: 7 days fro
m now)
? Choose the default authorization type for the API: "API key"
? Configure additional auth types? "No"

? Here is the GraphQL API that we will create. Select a setting to edit or continue (Use arrow keys)
  Name: datastorepkinteg
  Authorization modes: API key
  Conflict detection (required for DataStore): Enabled
  Conflict resolution strategy: Auto Merge
? Choose a schema template: Blank Schema
```

Copy the content of the schema from `AWSDataStoreCategoryPluginIntegrationTests/PrimaryKey/schema.graphql` into the newly created `schema.graphql` file

3. `amplify update api`
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: `GraphQL`
? Select from the options below `Enable DataStore for entire API`

4. `amplify push`
```perl
? Are you sure you want to continue? `Yes`
? Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API `No`
```

5. Copy `amplifyconfiguration.json` to a new file named `AWSDataStoreCategoryPluginPrimaryKeyIntegrationTests-amplifyconfiguration.json` inside `~/.aws-amplify/amplify-ios/testconfiguration/`


Now you can run the AWSDataStoreCategoryPluginPrimaryKeyIntegrationTests

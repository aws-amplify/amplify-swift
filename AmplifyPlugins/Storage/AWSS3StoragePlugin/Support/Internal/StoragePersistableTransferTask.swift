/*
Note: Multipart Uploads will have a request for the creation request, each part upload and the complete or abort
 requests. These tasks are persisted separately with a unique TransferID for each one where the create task will
 not have a sessionTask and so it will not have a taskIdentifier while each part upload will have a session Task
 and taskIdentifier and will be linked to the multipart upload by the uploadId and part number. When recovering
 from an app restart it will be necessary to compose these tasks back together to create an instance of
 MultiplePartUpload in the correct state. If there is not an uploadId it will not be persisted as the process has
 not started. If it has been persisted then there should be parts which will be subTasks which are loaded and each
 one may be completed already and have an eTag set, otherwise the sessionTask from URLSession will be able to
 provide the taskIdentifier which is necessary when the URLSession delegate methods are called which provide the
 taskIdentifier. This value is used to find the StorageTransferTask so that updates can be reported with the
 onEvent closure which is given when the Storage operation is started.

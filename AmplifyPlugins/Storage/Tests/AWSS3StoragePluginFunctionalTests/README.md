## Storage Integration Tests

The following steps demonstrate how to set up Storage with unauthenticated and authenticated access.In the case of authenticated access, we will be using Cognito UserPools. Both unauthenticated and authenticated configurations are used to execute the AWSS3StoragePluginFunctionalTests. This set up is used to run the tests in AWSS3StoragePluginFunctionalTests


### Set-up

1. `amplify init`

2. `amplify add storage`

```perl
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: `Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`

    Manual configuration
Select the authentication/authorization services that you want to use: 
    User Sign-Up, Sign-In, connected with AWS IAM controls (Enables ...)
Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project: 
    <amplifyintegtest>
Please enter a name for your identity pool. 
    <amplifyintegtestCIDP>
Allow unauthenticated logins? (Provides scoped down permissions that you can control via AWS IAM) 
    Yes
Do you want to enable 3rd party authentication providers in your identity pool? 
    No

    Yes
Do you want to restrict access to the admin queries API to a specific Group 
    No
Multifactor authentication (MFA) user login options:

Do you want to override the default password policy for this User Pool? 
    No
 
What attributes are required for signing up? 
   (Press Space to deselect Email, if selected, then press Enter with none selected)
 Specify the app's refresh token expiration period (in days):

    No
Do you want to enable any of the following capabilities?
    (press Enter with none selected)
Do you want to use an OAuth flow?

Do you want to configure Lambda Triggers for Cognito? 
    Yes
Which triggers do you want to enable for Cognito
    Pre Sign-up
What functionality do you want to use for Pre Sign-up 
    Create your own module
Succesfully added the Lambda function locally
Do you want to edit your custom function now? Yes
Please edit the file in your editor: 
```

For Pre Sign-up lambda

```
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  event.response.autoConfirmUser = true;
  return event
};
```

Continue in the terminal;

```
? Press enter to continue

Successfully added auth resource
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project: `s3f34a5918`
? Please provide bucket name: `<BucketName>`
? Who should have access: `Auth and guest users`
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? `create/update, read, delete`
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users? `create/update, read, delete`
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket? `No`
```

3. `amplify push`


4. Copy `amplifyconfiguration.json` as `AWSS3StoragePluginTests-amplifyconfiguration.json` inside `~/.aws-amplify/amplify-ios/testconfiguration/`

```
cp amplifyconfiguration.json ~/.aws-amplify/amplify-ios/testconfiguration/AWSS3StoragePluginTests-amplifyconfiguration.json
```

You should now be able to run all of the tests from AWSS3StoragePluginAccessLevelTests

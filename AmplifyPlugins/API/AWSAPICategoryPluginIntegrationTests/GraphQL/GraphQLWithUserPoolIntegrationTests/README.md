## GraphQL with UserPool Auth Integration Tests

The following steps demonstrate how to set up an GraphQL endpoint with AppSync. The auth configured will be Cognito UserPools. This set up is used to run the tests in `GraphQLWithUserPoolIntegrationTests.swift`.

### Set-up

Latest tested with amplify CLI version 8.0.1 `amplify -v`

* Note that these integration tests are only compatible with the V1 Transformer. * 

1. `amplify init`

2. `amplify add api`

```perl

? Provide API name: `<APIName>`
? Choose the default authorization type for the API `Amazon Cognito User Pool`
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? 
    Manual configuration
Select the authentication/authorization services that you want to use: 
    User Sign-Up, Sign-In, connected with AWS IAM controls (Enables ...)
Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project: 
    <amplifyintegtest>
Please enter a name for your identity pool. 
    <amplifyintegtestCIDP>
Allow unauthenticated logins? (Provides scoped down permissions that you can control via AWS IAM) 
    No
Do you want to enable 3rd party authentication providers in your identity pool? 
    No
Please provide a name for your user pool: 
    <amplifyintegCUP>

Do you want to add an admin queries API? 
    Yes
Do you want to restrict access to the admin queries API to a specific Group 
    No
Multifactor authentication (MFA) user login options: 
    OFF
 
Email based user registration/forgot password:

Please specify an email verification message: 
    Your verification code is {####}
Do you want to override the default password policy for this User Pool? 
    No

Do you want to configure Lambda Triggers for Cognito? 
    Yes
Which triggers do you want to enable for Cognito
    Pre Sign-up
    [Choose as many that you would like to manually verify later]
What functionality do you want to use for Pre Sign-up

Succesfully added the Lambda function locally
Do you want to edit your custom function now? Yes
Please edit the file in your editor:

? Do you want to configure advanced settings for the GraphQL API `No, I am done.`
? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? `No`
? Do you want a guided schema creation? `Yes`
? What best describes your project: `Single object with fields (e.g., “Todo” with ID, name, description)`
? Do you want to edit the schema now? `No`
```

The guided schema provided should look like this: 
```json
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}
```

3. If you are using the latest CLI, update cli.json to include `"useExperimentalPipelinedTransformer": false` to ensure that it will use the v1 transformer.

4. `amplify push`

```perl
? Are you sure you want to continue? `Yes`
? Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API `No`
```

5. Copy `amplifyconfiguration.json` as `GraphQLWithUserPoolIntegrationTests-amplifyconfiguration.json` inside `~/.aws-amplify/amplify-ios/testconfiguration/`

```
cp amplifyconfiguration.json ~/.aws-amplify/amplify-ios/testconfiguration/GraphQLWithUserPoolIntegrationTests-amplifyconfiguration.json
```

6. Run the rest of the tests.

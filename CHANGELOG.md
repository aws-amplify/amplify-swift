## 1.6.0 (2021-02-04)

### Features

- Support lazy load and pagination for API (#1009)
- Separate DataStore List logic out to list provider (#1000)

### Behavior Change

- **Auth**: Fix cancelling hostedUI returning a generic error (#982).

    When a user cancels the sign in flow from `Amplify.Auth.signInWithWebUI`, the callback will now deliver an error of type `AuthError.service`, with an underlying error of `AWSCognitoAuthError.userCancelled`. Previously, the error was a `SFAuthenticationError.canceledLogin`. The `AuthError.service` error type will be returned regardless of whether the underlying HostedUI operation was performed via an SFAuthenticationSession or an ASWebAuthenticationSession.
    
    You can detect the user cancellation case by `switch`ing on the error, as in:
    
    ```swift
    switch result {
      case .success:
          print("SignOut")
      case .failure(let error):
          if case AuthError.service(_, _, let underlyingError) = error,
              case .userCancelled = (underlyingError as? AWSCognitoAuthError) {
              print("User cancelled")
          }
    }
    ```

### Misc updates

- **Auth**: `Amplify.Auth.signInWithWebUI` now automatically uses `ASWebAuthenticationSession` internally for iOS 13.0+. For older iOS versions, it will fall back to `SFAuthenticationSession`.
    This release also introduces a new `preferPrivateSession` flag to `AWSAuthWebUISignInOptions` during the sign in flow. If `preferPrivateSession` is set to `true` during sign in, and the user's preferred browser supports [`ASWebAuthenticationSession.prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession/3237231-prefersephemeralwebbrowsersessio), the user will not see a web view displayed when they sign out. 

    ```swift
    Amplify.Auth.signInWithWebUI(presentationAnchor: self.view.window!, 
                                options: .preferPrivateSession()) { ... }
    ```

## 1.0.2 (2020-06-25)

### Bug Fixes

* **Auth** Signout will completely delete the session in webui ([#542](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios/pull/542))

* **DataStore** Fixed a DataStore issue where lazy `List<M>` initialization would fail for relationships 3+ levels deep ([#534](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios/pull/534))
* **DataStore** Model schema updates clears local database on configure ([#551](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios/pull/551))

This bug impacts developers with schemas containing embedded types when using DataStore with sync to cloud enabled or using API with Model classes.

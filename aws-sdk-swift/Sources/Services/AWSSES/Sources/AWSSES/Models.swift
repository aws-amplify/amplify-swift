If you want to send to or from email addresses that contain Unicode characters in the domain part of an address, you must encode the domain using Punycode. Punycode is not permitted in the local part of the email address (the part before the @ sign) nor in the "friendly from" name. If you want to use Unicode characters in the "friendly from" name, you must encode the "friendly from" name using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in [Sending raw email using the Amazon SES API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-raw.html). For more information about Punycode, see [RFC 3492](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492).

Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ResourceOwner is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation. If the ResourceOwner parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in CallerArn. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user CallerArn. The ARN for an account uses the following syntax: arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:root. For example, to represent the account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN: arn:aws:iam::112233445566-ID:root.
    public var resourceOwner: Swift.String?
    /// A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation. The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see [IAM and STS character quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length).

    ///
    /// * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \u00FF)

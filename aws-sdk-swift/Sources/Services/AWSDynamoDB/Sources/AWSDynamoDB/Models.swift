If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.

In addition, if you use ADD to update an existing item, and intend to increment or decrement an attribute value which does not yet exist, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update does not yet have an attribute named itemcount, but you decide to ADD the number 3 to this attribute anyway, even though it currently does not exist. DynamoDB will create the itemcount attribute, set its initial value to 0, and finally add 3 to it. The result will be a new itemcount attribute in the item, with a value of 3.

An error occurs if an Add action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. Both sets must have the same primitive data type.

If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation reads only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.

# Migrating from AWS SDK for iOS to Amplify Swift

This guide helps you migrate your iOS app from the legacy AWS SDK for iOS to the modern [Amplify Swift](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen1/swift/) library. 

---

## General Migration Notes

- **Amplify Swift** is the recommended library for all new iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS development.
- For any AWS service not yet supported by Amplify, you can use the [AWS SDK for Swift](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-swift) or reference [Swift SDK code examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/swift).
- For IoT, migrate to the [AWS IoT Device SDK for Swift](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-swift/blob/main/Package.swift).
- Amplify will make a best-effort attempt to preserve user auth sessions during migration, but some users may need to re-authenticate.

---

### AWS IoT

Amplify currently does **not** expose an IoT category. Use the standalone [**AWS IoT Device SDK for Swift**](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-swift/blob/main/Package.swift), which works side‑by‑side with Amplify.

```swift
// Example: Connect & subscribe with AWS IoT Device SDK Swift
import AwsIot
...
```

---

## When Amplify doesn't cover a service

For AWS services without an Amplify category (e.g., Amazon SQS, EventBridge, DynamoDB Streams) import the **AWS SDK for Swift** directly.\
See runnable examples in the [aws‑doc‑sdk‑examples/swift](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/swift) repository.

> **Tip** – You can share credentials between Amplify and AWS SDK by passing `Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession()` credentials into service client configuration.

---

## Migration checklist

1. **Remove** SDK pods / SPM packages for `AWSMobileClient`, `AWSS3TransferUtility`, etc.
2. **Create or import** your backend in **Amplify Gen 2** console and download the generated configuration (or run `amplify pull`).
3. **Add** Amplify libraries and required plugins via SPM.
4. Initialize Amplify in your App's entry point.
5. Replace legacy calls using the tables above.
6. Build & test: verify
   - Existing users stay signed in
   - S3 uploads/downloads work
   - API calls succeed
   - Analytics events appear in Pinpoint

## FAQ

> **Can I mix AWS Mobile SDK for iOS and Amplify Swift (Amplify v2) in the same app?**
>
> **No.** AWS Amplify explicitly does **not** support using the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS and Amplify Swift (Amplify v2) together in the same app. This is due to overlapping implementations, conflicting dependencies, and import issues. Attempting to use both in the same project can result in unpredictable behavior, build errors, and runtime issues.
>
> For a successful migration, you must **fully remove** the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS from your project before integrating Amplify Swift (Amplify v2).

**Will my users be forced to sign in again?**\
No. When Amplify is pointed at the same Cognito User Pool and key‑chain location, it detects cached refresh tokens and continues the session automatically.
